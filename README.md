# Entropy

Entropy is a fast-paced dodging game meant to engage and enthrall players 
with complex patterns and difficult boss battles.  The crux of the project
is mathematical bullet trajectories designed to confuse and disorient the
intrepid players, and the objective is to defeat each of three challenging
bosses.

Entropy was created at HackUCI 2017 with a team of three freshman Computer
Science students.  Given our total lack of experience, I am incredibly proud
of what we managed to accomplish.  This project marked my first hackathon
and propelled me down a path to fully embrace software development.
